5 methods of building models:
    1. All-In
    2. Backwards elimination
    3. Forward selection
    4. Bidirectional elimination
    5. Score comparison
        **3,4,5{Stepwise regression}
        
1. All-In: throw in all your vars
    if you have prior knowlege OR
    required by a framework you are using(maybe bank reqs vars to predict chances of default on credit)
    preparing for backward elimination
    
Backward elimination
1. Select significance level to stay in the model (e.g. SL = 0.05)
